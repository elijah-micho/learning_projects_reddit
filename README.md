Practice project ideas taken from reddit!

This is a collection of project ideas taken from this reddit post.
      https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/aue19f/the_projects_that_helped_me_learn/
These are not complicated however I found these to be helpful in applying my acquired Python knowledge
so far in practical ways.

The projects themselves are located within the venv folder (whoops!)
